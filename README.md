# EnglishTranslator
Super fun project using a Python Script to run IBM Watson Text to Speech API and IBM Watson Language Translator.

Input: An English word, sentance, or paragraph.
Input: A language from those listed (we chose to support only those that had an appropriate voice file availible)

Output: Writing of sentance in selected language
Output: A .wav file of the audio being spoken by an appropriate translator will be dropped into the directory.

To Run: 
Download Python3 and IBM Watson using pip3 install 
Download the python file
cd to the directory of the python file, run the python file using "python3 FILENAME.py"
